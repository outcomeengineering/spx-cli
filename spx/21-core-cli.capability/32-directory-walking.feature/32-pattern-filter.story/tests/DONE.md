# Story 32: Pattern Filter - DONE

**Completion Date:** 2026-01-04

## Files Created/Modified

### Source Files

1. `src/scanner/walk.ts` - Added `filterWorkItemDirectories()` function

### Test Files

1. `specs/doing/capability-21_core-cli/feature-32_directory-walking/story-32_pattern-filter/tests/walk.test.ts` - Level 1 unit tests

## Test Results

**Test Location:** `specs/doing/.../story-32_pattern-filter/tests/walk.test.ts`
**Test Level:** Level 1 (Unit Tests)
**Test Count:** 3 tests
**Status:** ✅ All passing

### Test Coverage

- ✅ Directories with work item names are included
- ✅ Non-work-item directories are excluded
- ✅ Mixed patterns are correctly filtered

## Implementation Summary

Implemented `filterWorkItemDirectories()` as a pure function that:

- Filters directory entries to include only valid work item patterns
- Uses `parseWorkItemName()` from Feature 21 for pattern validation
- Safely handles invalid patterns (try/catch returns false)
- No filesystem operations - pure logic

## Quality Metrics

- **BDD Structure:** ✅ All tests use GIVEN/WHEN/THEN
- **No Mocking:** ✅ Uses real functions, no mocks
- **Type Safety:** ✅ Full TypeScript coverage
- **Error Handling:** ✅ Safe error handling via try/catch

## Graduation Notes

Tests will be graduated to `tests/unit/scanner/walk.test.ts` when feature is complete.
